    <h3>Welcome visitor, to The Micronational Directory!</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation" target="_blank"><b>Micronations</b></a> are quite a particular political phenomena
      that have decades, and even arguably centuries of existence. There could be many different reasons for a micronation to be founded
      and to aspire for a long run of activity, and legacy. Some cases may be linked with ethnicity or social conflicts, others are a demonstration of
      political debate and experiment, there are also fraudulent scams, as well as examples of mere exercise of the human imagination or ambition,
      and some are even basically jokes. No matter the origin, they all share a common root: their founders and citizens <span class="italicized">
      "[...] claim that they belong to an independent nation or sovereign state, but which lacks legal recognition by world governments or major international
      organizations [...]"</span>, as described by Wikipedia.
      <br><br>
      These small political entities are scattered all around the world. That means not only Earth, but also the digital realm and some even
      have territorial pretensions over other planets and the space itself. But also within a vast range of time: there are cases that can fall
      within this category that were founded in the 19th century, and up to this day, when nowadays social media provide home to a plethora of digital
      micronations.
      <br><br>
      It's not the intention of this website to dive deeper in the micronational debate or description, nor to gather an exhaustive amount of information
      in order to compose an article for each micronation, because there are other well-renowned previously-existing great websites for this purpose, such as
      <a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">MicroWiki</a>. Also micronational organizations and other small encyclopedias have info.
      Therefore, the goal of <b>The Micronational Directory</b> team of micronationalists and developers is instead to gather and build the most complete list
      of unified entries as possible, in order to have a common, massive database for listing everything in one place, inspite of characteristics and criteria. Let's
      accomplish this together, leave your mark and create the place that our community deserves!
