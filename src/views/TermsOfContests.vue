        <h1 class="underlined">What are Contests</h1>
        <p>
            From time to time, The Micronational Directory will host events in the form of contests, in which
            <b>registered users</b> from the platform will be able to participate and compete between each other for prizes.
            <b>These events carry the intention of acting as a large-scale cooperative campaign for submitting entries in
                our Directory, the main mission of this website</b>, and granting awards to the users with most
            contributions as a clear incentive to accomplish this purpose. Therefore, the very spirit of celebrating them is
            to enforce the meaning of the digital library we are building all together. Contests will have a clear and
            established duration for submitting entries that will be eligible for the final count, which ultimately serves
            as the first rule for determining the winner(s).
        </p>
        <h2>How to participate in Contests</h2>
        <p>
            In order to be part of this kind of events, participants will require to <b>have a registered account in TMD,
                with
                verified email address, and be logged in</b> when submitting entries. After performing this action and only
            if the entry is approved by the staff, the user
            will
            add one (1) entry point to their personal count. Entries submitted before the closure of a contest but approved
            after it will still qualify for the count, as TMD destines a period of time for this precise situation. Counts
            for each player can be tracked in the Stats section of
            our website. This count applies only for the ongoing contest, and will reset after it's over and a new one
            starts, eventually. Additionally, there is also an all-time ranking that counts every entry submitted without
            considering any period of time or contest, and serves a mere statistical reason.
        </p>
        <h2>Duration of Contests</h2>
        <p>
            A starting date and time and a finishing date and time are set for the contest, for it to occur during this
            inverval. This information will be publicly disclosed in our website beforehand, so users will have enough time
            to prepare for the occasion. We use the <b>UTC timezone for all dates and times</b> stated at Contests. From
            the moment
            that the finishing time is reached, any entry submitted after it will not be
            considered for the contest and won't grant an entry point to the player. The same situation happens with the
            starting time; if an entry is submitted before it, it won't be valid for the contest. Google Firebase, the
            third-party backend solution that we use in our website, has the ability to precisely measure time in which new
            documents are created whithin our database, so this matter is well-covered.
        </p>
        <h2>How to win a Contest</h2>
        <p>
            The user or player that <b>accrues the highest amount of valid entries</b> submitted within the specified range
            of time
            of a contest will be proclaimed as the winner. In case there are two or more players with the same amount of
            entry points on first place, the <b>earliest valid and ultimately-approved submitted entry will act as the tie
                breaker</b>,
            meaning that only one player can
            be eligible as absolute winner. In the rare event that two or more players are tied in this aspect as well, a
            random selection will be conducted to determine the user that will stand on better position, using online tools
            that are meant for this matter. The same criteria are applied when defining the runner-ups, which usually are
            going to be two (second and third positions).
        </p>
        <h2>Prizes at Contests</h2>
        <p><b>Only players that have reached at least ten (10) entry points in a contest can aspire to earn prizes</b>. This
            doesn't interfere with the proclamation of the winner and the runner-ups, but will rather exclude them from the
            possibility of acquiring the reward. So, in the theoretical scenario where the winner finishes with 9 entry
            points, and the runner-ups with 7 and 5 entry points respectively, none of them will receive the prize expected
            for that position but <b>will still maintain their competitive status</b>. This is the same to say that a winner
            or a runner-up can be a winner or a runner-up but still not receive the prize if they fail to equal or surpass
            the threshold of minimum amount of entry points.<br>
            The type of prizes and the amount for each of them will vary between contests and positions within the final
            ranking of entry points. Usually, the winner and the following two (2) runner-ups will receive a prize if
            it's the case, but this can also change from event to event. These are the following types of prizes that can
            exist for a contest, and we are also including a description on the procedure for obtaining them:
        </p>
        <p>
            - <span class="underlined">Discounts at MicroFlag</span>: our partner MicroFlag can provide discounts at its
            online store as a form of prize. The quantity of the discount is subject to specificity in each contest and each
            position.
            When a contest is finished, TMD will acknowledge the beneficiaries through the final ranking and pass on the
            information to MicroFlag, indicating the emails of the users in question. In order to obtain their prize,
            beneficiaries will simply need to initiate a purchase process in MicroFlag using the same email to which the
            discount was awarded, and it will be applied. After that, the purchasing process will continue as standard on
            the store. The discount applies only for one (1) purchase at MicroFlag, and it's indifferent if the user has
            previously bought on the store or not. This discount cannot be combined with other benefits from MicroFlag.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <span class="underlined">Fixed amounts in USD or USDC</span>: this prize is awarded by TMD, and the amount
            of the prize will depend on the contest and the position in question. When a contest is finished, TMD will
            acknowledge the beneficiaries through the final ranking and make a formal contact via their account email
            noticing the situation to them. At this point, TMD will ask the beneficiaries <b>whether if they desire to
                obtain the fixed amount in USD (United States dollar) currency, or in USDC (USD Coin) cryptocurrency</b>.
            The awarded user has <b>7 full days to reply to this enquiry</b>, starting from the moment this email was sent.
            If the user <b>fails to comply with this time frame, the prize will be revoked</b> and will not be awarded to
            them.
            In case the beneficiary opts for USD, they will need to include their <b>Paypal account email</b> on their
            reply.
            This is the only platform in which the prize can be provided for this option. In case the beneficiary opts for
            USDC, they will need to provide their <b>Ethereum public address</b> on their reply. From this moment, <b>TMD
                can grant the prize at any time during the following 15 full days</b> after the user's reply. Once this is
            performed, the user will receive a new email from TMD that will contain the transaction information, regardless
            of the option, for the delivery of the prize. If it's not possible for them to acquire the prize in any of the
            forementioned methods, and the beneficiary wishes to make use of that amount for a purchase in MicroFlag, <b>we can
            act as an intermediate and provide the funds directly to MicroFlag</b>, and so the user will have that amount
            deducted from the subtotal.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            - Users of the platform that are directly (such as founders, developers, any person at the staff) or indirectly
            (such as moderators or advertisers) related to TMD, or related to any of our partners or sponsors, or related to
            any position of power that may fall within the category of capable of tampering, manipulating or changing the
            course of action of a contest, <b>are NOT eligible for acquiring prizes in contests</b>. They can still
            participate for entertainment purposes, but if they were to end up placed in a position in the final ranking
            that involves the awardment of a prize, that benefit will be conferred to the user placed in the next position
            (tie-breaking rules apply normally if there is a tie in entry points between the following two or more involved
            users).
        </p>
        <p>
            - It's forbidden for multiple people to share and use the same single account in our platform during contests.
            An account is a personal, non-transferable data element that belongs to a single person. With Google Firebase,
            our third-party resource, we can track IPs that log in to every account and detect anomalies that may indicate
            several users making use of them. If this situation is discovered by TMD during the course of a contest, the
            problematic account will be automatically disqualified from the contest.
